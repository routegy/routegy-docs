## What is Routegy?

Reporting issues around the workplace is painful, and people wait until things are dire or never report at all. This leads to unhappy employees and an operations team that’s constantly putting out fires.

[Routegy](https://routegy.com) simplifies the workplace experience by making it quick and easy for people to report issues and make requests. Issues are reported by scanning QR codes or NFC tags (no app required), pressing IoT buttons, or triggering sensors. They are then routed to the destination of your choice, whether that’s a CMMS, email, text, or whatever combination of tools you use for your business. With Routegy, you’ll discover issues faster and keep people happy.

## How the documentation is organized

* [Tutorials](tutorial/) take you by the hand through a series of steps to get the most out of Routegy. _Start here if you’re new to Routegy._
* [Topic guides](topic/) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
* [Reference guides](reference/) contain deeper technical details for things like API's, client libraries, and tool integrations. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a more solid understanding of key concepts.
* [How-to guides](how-to/) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume a more solid understanding of key concepts.
