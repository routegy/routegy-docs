# Routegy documentation

Everything you need to know about Routegy.

## How the documentation is organized

* [Tutorials](tutorial/) take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a Routegy workspace. _Start here if youâ€™re new to Routegy._
* [Topic guides](topic/) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
* [Reference guides](reference/) contain deeper technical details for things like API's, client libraries, and tool integrations. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a more solid understanding of key concepts.
* [How-to guides](how-to/) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume a more solid understanding of key concepts.
