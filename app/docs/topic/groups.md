# Groups

A group represents a physical space. Groups are structured in a tree hierarchy so you can describe most complex structures with them.

An example of a hierarchy of groups could be:

```
> University Campus
    > Jamrich Building
        > 2nd Floor
            > Classroom 251
```

A group has zero or more [apps](/topic/apps/), which define common interactions relative to that group. an app requesting more printer paper makes sense for an office supply room group but does not make sense for a bathroom group.
