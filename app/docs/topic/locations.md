# Locations

A location represents a physical space. Locations are structured in a tree hierarchy so you can describe most complex structures with them.

An example of a hierarchy of locations could be:

```
> University Campus
    > Jamrich Building
        > 2nd Floor
            > Classroom 251
```

A location has zero or more [touchpoints](/topic/touchpoints/), which define common interactions relative to that location. A touchpoint requesting more printer paper makes sense for an office supply room location but does not make sense for a bathroom location.
