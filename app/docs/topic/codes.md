# Codes

Codes are used to identify [microapps](/topic/microapps) with an opaque identifier and are normally seen as a URL. These URL's can encoded into microapps like QR codes, NFC tags, API clients, etc.

Code URL's will be optionally encoded with metadata as to indicate the physical microapp referencing them.

Users do not need to worry about managing codes as creating a microapp will automatically create a code.

If a code is not linked to a microapp, you must go through the [provision flow](/topic/provision-flow.html) to link them.

### Examples

| Code | URL | Metadata |
| ---- | --- | -------- |
| yPe9BPD | https://rtgy.io/yPe9BPD?o=qr | Microapp is a QR code
| VRnekwa | https://rtgy.io/VRnekwa | Microapp is a Direct link
| y42gVPg | https://rtgy.io/y42gVPg?o=nfc | Microapp is an NFC tag
