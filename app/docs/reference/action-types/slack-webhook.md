# Slack webhook

The Slack webhook action type is used to send a message to Slack for every [event](/reference/events/) created by an [app](/reference/apps/). Messages are sent using [incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for Slack apps.

You can customize the body and footer of the message, both of which support [Routegy templating](/reference/templating).
