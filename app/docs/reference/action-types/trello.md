# Trello

The Trello action type is used to create cards in a configured board/list for every [event](/reference/events/) created by an [app](/reference/apps/).


Configuration options include Trello API key token, the ID of the Trello list where the new card will be create, and a card name and description for the new card. Both name and description support [Routegy templating](/reference/templating).
