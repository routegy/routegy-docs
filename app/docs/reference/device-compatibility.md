# Devices compatible with QR and NFC apps

Interacting with Routegy QR and NFC apps uses built-in capabilities of a person's device. These capabilities are a standard feature in most modern iOS and Android devices.

## iOS device compatibility

QR code reading capability is built into the camera app on iPhones, iPads and iPods that run **iOS 11** or newer.

NFC tag reading capability is supported in **iOS 13** (and newer) on the following devices: iPhone XS, XS Max, XR, 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max.

## Android device compatibility

QR code reading capability is built into the camera app on devices that run **Android 9** or newer. Devices that run **Android 8** can scan QR codes by using the Google Lens app.

NFC tag reading is built into most modern Android devices.
