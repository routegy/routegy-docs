## 2. Navigate to your workspace

After logging in you should be on the [workspaces page](https://web.routegy.com). [Workspaces](/reference/workspaces) help you organize and separate your apps. We create your first workspace for you. Click it!

## 3. Open your first app

[Apps](/reference/apps) are what people interact with, and we create your first app for you. Click it!

## 4. Create your first event

[Events](reference/events) happen whenever someone uses one of your apps. Click the QR code or scan it with your phone's camera.

Enter your name and hit 'Submit.' That's all there is to it.

### Your first event notification!

Back in Routegy, you'll see a little red balloon notifying you that someone interacted with your app. Click it (or click the `Events` tab). There you'll find your new event. Click it to view the details.

### But that's not all. Check your email!

Check the email address you used to sign up for Routegy. You should see an email notification that someone used your app. This was done using an [action](/reference/actions), which tells Routegy what to do with events. The app you interacted with is configured with an action that emails you when someone clicks the 'Submit' button.
