# Receive Email Notifications

This document describes how to make use of the [Email Action Type](/reference/action-types/email/) to receive email notifications when someone interacts with one of your apps.

Email actions are commonly used for lower-priority [apps](/reference/apps/) that can be addressed in an asynchronous fashion.

## Create the action

Follow the steps below to create an [action](/reference/actions/) for sending email notifications.

### Step 1: Choose a workspace

Start by making sure you're in the desired [workspace](/reference/workspaces/). Hover over the menu bar dropdown to choose.
