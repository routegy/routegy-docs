# Receive Email Notifications

This document describes how to make use of the [Email Action Type](/reference/action-types/email/) to receive email notifications.

Email actions are commonly used for lower priority [apps](/reference/apps/) that can be addressed in an asynchronous fashion.

## Creating the Action

Follow the steps below to create a [action](/reference/actions/) for sending email notifications.

### Step 1

Start by making sure you're in the desired [workspace](/reference/workspaces/). Click on the menu bar dropdown to choose.
